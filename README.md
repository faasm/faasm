# Faasm [![Tests](https://github.com/lsds/faasm/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/lsds/faasm/actions)  [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lsds/faasm.svg)](https://github.com/lsds/faasm/blob/master/LICENSE.md)  [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/lsds/faasm.svg)](https://github.com/lsds/faasm/releases/)  [![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/lsds/faasm.svg)](https://github.com/lsds/faasm/graphs/contributors/)

Faasm is a high-performance stateful serverless runtime. 

Faasm provides multi-tenant isolation, yet allows functions to share regions of
memory. These shared memory regions give low-latency concurrent access to data,
and are synchronised globally to support large-scale parallelism.

Faasm combines software fault isolation from WebAssembly with standard Linux
tools, to provide security and resource isolation at low cost. Faasm runs
functions side-by-side as threads of a single runtime process, with low
overheads and fast boot times. 

Faasm is built on [Faabric](http://github.com/faasm/faabric) which provides
the distributed messaging and state layer. 

The underlying WebAssembly execution and code
generation is handled by [WAVM](https://github.com/WAVM/WAVM). 

Faasm defines a custom [host interface](docs/host_interface.md) which extends
[WASI](https://wasi.dev/) to include function inputs and outputs, chaining
functions, managing state, accessing the distributed filesystem, dynamic
linking, pthreads, OpenMP and MPI.   

Our paper from Usenix ATC '20 on Faasm can be found
[here](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/shillaker).

# Quick start

You can start a Faasm cluster locally using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the
root of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up --scale worker=2
```

Then run the Faasm CLI, from which you can build, deploy and invoke functions:

```bash
# Start the CLI
./bin/cli.sh

# Upload the demo "hello" function
inv upload demo hello

# Invoke the function
inv invoke demo hello
```

Note that the first time you run the local set-up it will generate some machine
code specific to your host. This is stored in the `machine-code` directory in
the root of the project and reused on subsequent runs.
