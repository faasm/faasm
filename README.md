Faasm is a high-performance stateful serverless runtime. 

Faasm provides multi-tenant isolation, but also lets functions share regions of memory. 
These shared memory regions give low-latency concurrent access to data, and are synchronised 
globally to support large-scale parallelism.

Faasm combines software fault isolation from WebAssembly with standard Linux tools, to provide 
security and resource isolatation at low cost. Faasm runs functions side-by-side as threads 
of a single runtime process, with low overheads and fast boot times. The underlying WebAssembly
execution and code generation is handled by [WAVM](https://github.com/WAVM/WAVM). 

Faasm defines a custom [host interface](docs/host_interface.md) which lets functions perform 
serverless-specific tasks (e.g. invoking other functions and managing state), as well as interacting 
with the underlying host (e.g. using the filesystem and networking). The Faasm host interface achieves
the same goal as [WASI](https://wasi.dev/), but in a serverless-specific context.

A preprint of our paper on Faasm can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09344).

# Quick start

You can start a Faasm cluster locally using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up --scale worker=2
```

Then run the Faasm CLI, from which you can build, deploy and invoke functions:

```bash
# Start the CLI
./bin/cli.sh

# Upload the demo "hello" function
inv upload demo hello

# Invoke the function
inv invoke demo hello
```

Note that the first time you run the local set-up it will generate some machine code specific 
to your host. This is stored in the `machine-code` directory in the root of the project and reused 
on subsequent runs.
