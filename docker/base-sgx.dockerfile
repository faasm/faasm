# 09/03/2022 - As part of the preparation step, we download pre-built binaries
# from Intel's official repositories. There does not seem to be a clear way
# to specify which version to download. We pin to code version 2.15.101.1. It
# may happen that, at some point, the image build fails because the preparation
# script points to out-of-date links. In that case we will have to clone from a
# more recent tag.
