# NOTE - extensive use of Ansible in this Dockerfile makes it
# poor at taking advantage of the Docker build cache, so it can
# be a pain to develop. This is a necessary evil that avoids the
# need to create and maintain install/ setup code in this Dockerfile
# that already exists in the Ansible playbooks.
