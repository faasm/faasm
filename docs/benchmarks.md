# Benchmarks

## Runtimes

For efficiency measurements we want to assess the time taken and resources consumed by several different runtimes. To do this we need to measure the time taken, CPU cycles, peak memory and disk I/O for running a simple function (with a cold start).

Measuring the CPU cycles and time taken can be done with `perf` and `time` respectively (in separate runs). To measure memory footprint we take the footprint of the relevant process and all its descendants. To do this for Docker we need to take the footprint of the docker daemon and all of its child processes, thus capturing the whole cost of running Docker on the host.

Measurements are taken for a vanilla Docker container (Alpine) and Faasm, both running a noop function. The Docker container will run the unmodified native binary and Faasm will run its generated shared object from the WebAssembly for the function.

To amortize any start-up time and underlying system resources we run each for multiple iterations and varying numbers of workers (containers for Docker, threads for Faasm).

### Memory

What we mean by "footprint" is worth clarifying. The resident set size (RSS) is often used, however this double counts memory shared between two processes. A more appropriate measure is the proportional set size (PSS), which spreads the "cost" of any shared memory between those sharing it. 

For a multi-threaded single process like Faasm these two values are (almost) the same. For Docker though, it makes a big difference depending on the containers in question.

Docker containers from the same image will share the same layered filesystem. This means binaries and shared libraries are mapped into shared memory shared between the containers. If we have two containers from the same image, their PSS will be much lower than the sum of their RSS. If we have two containers from totally different images, the sum of their PSS will be much closer to the sum of their RSS.

In a multi-tenant environment the containers being run will likely be heterogeneous to some extent, but not completely. In our experiments we use container from exacly the same image, thus showing a big difference between PSS and RSS. The real world impact would be somewhere between these two.  

The Faasm memory footprint is quite a lot larger than standard threads running the same native code. Aside from the base cost of loading the libraries for the runtime itself, the incremental cost of adding more workers comes from the extra heap space. This heap space is taken up by the LLVM objects created by the JITing, WAVM objects holding the module definition, memories, tables and functions, plus the actual linear memory of the functions themselves.

### Set up

You must have generated the object files for Faasm up-front:

```
inv run-wasm-codegen
```

As well as built the `bench_mem`, `bench_time`, `thread_bench_mem` and `thread_bench_time` targets from this project.

For Docker you need to build the `faasm/noop` image which can be done with:

```
inv build-noop
```

### Running

The timing and CPU measurements can be taken by running:

```
inv bench-time
```

Results are written to `/tmp/runtime-bench-time.csv`.

The memory measurements require access to details of the Docker daemon, hence need to be run as root:

```
# Remove all Docker containers in case
docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm

# Run the benchmark as root
sudo su
source workon.sh
inv bench-mem
```

Results are written to `/tmp/runtime-bench-mem.csv`.


### Other runtimes

It would be nice to benchmark these similar overheads against Firecracker, however I haven't been able to script it
up yet. It can be set up by running:

```
cd ansible
ansible-playbook firecracker.yml --ask-become-pass
```

Lucet would also be interesting but it doesn't currently provide a
[full isolation environment](https://github.com/fastly/lucet/security/policy), therefore is not really comparable.

## Polybench/C

To test pure computation against the native environment we can use the
[Polybench/C benchmark](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~pouchet.2/software/polybench/).

The code is checked into this repository and can be compiled to wasm and uploaded as follows:

```
# Compile to wasm
inv compile --user=polybench --clean

# Upload (must have an upload server running)
inv upload-all
```

We can compile the same functions natively as follows:

```
./bin/build_polybench_native.sh
```

The `poly_bench` executable will then run a comparison of the wasm and native versions. This must
be invoked with your desired number of iterations for native and wasm respectively, e.g.

```
poly_bench all 5 5
```

Results are currently output to `/tmp/polybench.csv`.

_Note - we had to leave out the BLAS benchmarks as BLAS is not supported in Faasm_.

## Python

To benchmark CPython execution we use the [Python Performance Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/python/performance).

All python code runs in the same function which can be set up according to the python docs in this repo.

The set of benchmarks can be run with the `py_bench` executable. You can specify a specific benchmark or a single
benchmark, along with the number of wasm and native iterations, e.g. `py_bench all 100 100` or
`py_bench bench_float.py 200 200`. This will output to `/tmp/pybench.csv`.

Each benchmark requires porting the required dependencies, so some were unfeasible and other were too much work:

- `chameleon` - too many deps
- `django_template` - pulls in too many dependencies
- `hg_startup` - runs a shell command
- `html5lib` - dependencies (might be fine)
- `pathlib` - requires more access to the filesystem that we support
- `python_startup` - runs a shell command
- `regex_compile` - needs to import several other local modules (should be possible, just fiddly)
- SQL-related - SQLAlchemy not worth porting for now. SQLite also not supported but could be
- `sympy` - sympy module not yet ported but could be
- `tornado` - Tornado not ported (and don't plan to)


## Profiling

### Profiling Polybench/C

To profile the native version of the code, you need to run `./bin/build_polybench_native.sh Debug`

Then you can directly run the native binary:

```
perf record -k 1 ./func/build_native/polybench/poly_ludcmp
mv perf.data perf.data.native
perf report -i perf.data.native
```

Provided you have set up the wasm profiling set-up as described in the profiling docs, you can do something
similar:

```
perf record -k 1 poly_bench poly_ludcmp 0 5
perf inject -i perf.data -j -o perf.data.wasm
perf report -i perf.data.wasm
```

Note that for wasm code the output of the perf reports will be funciton names like `functionDef123`.
To generate the mapping of these names to the actual functions you can run the `func_sym` executable
e.g.

```
func_sym polybench 3mm
```
