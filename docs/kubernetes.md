# Faasm Kubernetes/ Knative integration

Faasm is a runtime designed to be integrated into other serverless platforms.
The recommended integration is with [Knative](https://knative.dev/).

All of Faasm's Kubernetes and Knative configuration can be found in the 
[k8s](../deploy/k8s) directory, and the relevant parts of the Faasm CLI can be 
found in the [Knative tasks](../tasks/knative.py).  

These steps generally assume that you have 
[`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) 
and [`kn`](https://knative.dev/docs/install/install-kn/) installed
and these are able to connect to your cluster.

## Cluster Set-up

### Google Kubernetes Engine

To set up Faasm on [GKE](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes) you can do the following:

- Set up an account and the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) ([Ubuntu quick start](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-debian-ubuntu))
- Create a Kubernetes cluster **with Istio enabled and version >=v1.15**
- Aim for >=4 nodes with more than one vCPU
- Set up your local `kubectl` to connect to your cluster (click the "Connect" button in the web interface)
- Check things are working by running `kubectl get nodes`
- Install Knative serving as described below

### Bare metal

If you're deploying on a bare-metal cluster then you need to update the `externalIPs` 
field in the `upload-service.yml` file to match your k8s master node. 

You also need to install Istio as described in [the Knative docs](https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/).

## Installation

### Knative

Faasm requires a minimal install of [Knative serving](https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/).
If your cluster doesn't already have Knative installed, you can run:

```bash
# Install
inv knative.install

# Check
kubectl get pods -n knative-serving
```  

### Faasm

You can then run the Faasm deploy (where `replicas` is the number of replicas in the Faasm pod):

```bash 
# Bare-metal/ GKE
inv knative.deploy --replicas=4

# Local
inv knative.deploy --local
```

This might take a couple of minutes depending on the underlying cluster.

## Config file

Once everything has started up, you can populate your `~/faasm/faasm.ini` file to avoid
typing in hostnames all the time. To do this, run:

```
./bin/knative_route.sh
```

Which should print out something like:

```
[Faasm]
invoke_host = ...   # Usually the IP of your master node
inoke_port = ...    # E.g. 31380
upload_host = ...   # IP of the upload service
upload_port = ...   # Usually 8002
```

You can then copy-paste this into `~/faasm/faasm.ini`.

## Uploading functions

Once you have configured your `~/faasm/faasm.ini` file, you can use the Faasm 
CLI as normal, e.g.

```
inv upload demo hello
inv invoke demo hello
```

## Flushing Redis

When workers die or are killed, you'll need to clear the queue:

```
inv redis.clear-queue --knative
```

## Uploading and running native functions

### C++

For benchmarking we need to run the functions in a more "normal" serverless way (i.e. natively 
in a container). To build the relevant container:

```
inv knative.build-native <user> <function>
```

This will use a parameterised Dockerfile to create a container that runs the given function 
natively. You can test locally with:

```
# Build the container
inv knative.build-native <user> <function> --nopush

# Start the container
inv knative.native-local <user> <function>

# Submit a request
inv invoke <user> <function> --native
```

Once you're happy you can run the following on your machine with knative access:

```
inv knative.deploy-native <user> <function>

inv invoke --native <user> <function>
```

**Note** For anything that requires chaining we must run it asynchronously so that things 
don't get clogged up. To do this:

```
inv invoke --native --poll <user> <function>
```

### Python

To run Python functions natively we use pyfaasm and a standard Flask-based knative Python 
executor. This can be found at `func/knative_native.py`. We can build the container with:

```
inv docker.build -c knative-native-python --push
```

To check things locally:

```
inv knative.native-python-local
inv invoke python hello --py
```

To deploy, from the machine with k8s access:

```
inv knative.deploy-native-python
```

## Troubleshooting

To look at the logs for the faasm containers:

```
# Find the faasm-worker-xxx pod
kubectl --namespace=faasm get pods

# Tail the logs for a specific pod
kubectl -n faasm logs -f faasm-worker-xxx user-container

# Tail the logs for all containers in the deployment
# You only need to specify the max-log-requests if you have more than 5 containers
kubectl -n faasm logs -f -c user-container -l serving.knative.dev/service=faasm-worker --max-log-requests=<N_CONTAINERS>

# Get all logs from the given deployment (add a very large --tail)
kubectl -n faasm logs --tail=100000 -c user-container -l serving.knative.dev/service=faasm-worker --max-log-requests=10 > /tmp/out.log
```

# Isolation and privileges

Faasm uses namespaces and cgroups to achieve isolation, therefore containers running 
Faasm workers need privileges that they don't otherwise have. The current solution to 
this is to run containers in `privileged` mode. This may not be available on certain 
clusters, in which case you'll need to set the following environment vars:
 
```
CGROUP_MODE=off
NETNS_MODE=off
```

## Redis-related set-up

There are a couple of tweaks required to handle running Redis, as detailed in the
[Redis admin docs](https://redis.io/topics/admin).

First you can turn off transparent huge pages (add `transparent_hugepage=never` 
to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` in `/etc/default/grub` and run `sudo update-grub`).

Then if testing under very high throughput you can set the following in `etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
# Connection-related
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15
net.core.somaxconn = 65535

# Memory-related
vm.overcommit_memory=1
```
