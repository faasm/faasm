# Local Development

This guide is only relevant for those wanting to dig deeper or make changes to
Faasm itself.  If you'd just like to write and run functions, you can refer to
the [set-up](setup.md) instructions. 

## Prerequisites

The Faasm codebase is all standard C/C++ and Python, however, local dev is only 
guaranteed to work with the following set-up:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Python 3.7
- Using **clang** to compile the code

All scripted CMake builds also use Ninja, so it's safest to use that too.

This means your CMake commands will look something like:

```
cmake \
    -GNinja \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang \
    ...
```

## Checking out the repo

For now, many locations rely on the code being located at
`/usr/local/code/faasm` (note the lowercase "f"), with the latter two 
directories _owned_ by the current user. This is annoying and something we will 
fix in future. 

You can either set this directory up directly, or just symlink it.

Assuming you've checked out this code somewhere, you'll need to make sure submodules are up to date:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Basic local machine set-up

Most of the local set-up is scripted with Ansible, but you need to have Python 3 and 
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) set up in advance.

The easiest way to do this is as follows:

```bash
# Python stuff and other dependencies
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv libcairo2-dev libtinfo5
sudo pip3 install -U pip

# Ansible
sudo pip install -U ansible

# Faasm python env 
source workon.sh
pip install -r faasmcli/requirements.txt

# Faasm CLI
pip install -e faasmcli/

# Faasm playbook
cd ansible
ansible-playbook local_dev.yml --ask-become-pass
```

If you want to tweak things yourself, look inside the `local_dev.yml` playbook to see what's required.

### Protobuf

Faasm depends on protobuf which should be installed with the playbook described above.

If there are any issue you need to remove every trace of any existing protobuf installation on your system before 
reinstalling.

You can look in the following folders and remove any reference to `libprotobuf` or `protobuf`:

- `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`
- `/usr/lib/`
- `/usr/include/google`

Avoid trying to do this with `apt` as it can accidentally delete a whole load of other stuff.

Install Protobuf manually:
```bash
# Install autoconf (if not present)
sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool

# Download Protobuf
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.11.4/protobuf-all-3.11.4.tar.gz

# Decompress downloaded files
tar -xvzf protobuf-all-3.11.4.tar.gz

# Make and install Protobuf
cd protobuf-all-3.11.4
./autogen
./configure --prefix=/usr CC=/usr/bin/clang CPP=/usr/bin/clang-cpp CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
make -j <Your number of threads> && make check -j <Your number of threads>
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

# Check protoc version

protoc --version (should return libprotoc 3.11.4)
```

## Toolchain and Runtime Root

The Faasm toolchain and runtime require some prebuilt files which can be downloaded with:

```bash
source workon.sh
inv toolchain.download-toolchain
inv toolchain.download-sysroot
```

If you want to build the toolchain from scratch, you'll need to look at the `toolchain.md` doc.

## Build Upload and Simple_runner

```bash
#Source workon.sh if it isn't already sourced
source workon.sh

# If not existing create build directory in root directory
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..

# Build upload and simple_runner
make upload simple_runner -j <Your number of threads>

# Open an additional console and start upload
sudo ./bin/upload

# Move back into Faasm root directory
cd ..

# compile & upload and call demo hello example
inv compile demo hello
inv upload demo hello
./build/bin/simple_runner demo hello
```

## Codegen and upload

To run the next parts you'll need to build the following targets with CMake:

- `codegen_func`
- `codegen_shared_obj`

Once finished, you need to add the resulting `bin` dir to your `$PATH`.

You can do this via your chosen IDE or with something like:

```bash
mkdir -p build/faasm && cd build/faasm
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ ../..
cmake --build . --target codegen_func
cmake --build . --target codegen_shared_obj

export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH
```

### Codegen for C++ functions

To run codegen for all the C++ functions:

```
inv codegen.local
```

### Python functions

You can pull down the prepackaged python runtime and required runtime files with:

```
inv toolchain.download-runtime
```

You can then put the Python functions in place with:

```
inv upload.user python --py --local-copy
```

## Networking

If you want to switch on network isolation locally, you need to set up network namespaces. To do this we need to
ensure consistent interface naming (`eth0` for main public interface). If your public interface is already called
`eth0` then you can skip this step.

- Edit `/etc/default/grub` and add `net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`
- Run `sudo update-grub`
- Restart the machine

This script will then set up the namespaces

```
sudo ./bin/netns.sh 20
```

## Cgroups

To use cgroup isolation, you'll need to run:

```
sudo ./bin/cgroup.sh
```

# CLion/ JetBrains

## Python

The Python files for Faasm are all contained in the nested `faasmcli` project. To get JetBrains IDEs
to correctly resolve imports, you can do one of:

- Mark the top-level `faasmcli` directory as a "Project sources" or equivalent in your IDE
- [Add an interpreter path](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-reloading-interpreter-paths.html#add). 
- Open the IDE directly in the `faasmcli` directory

## Remote development using CLion

CLion supports [remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/remote-development.html) which 
can be useful for developing Faasm inside a VM (or some other remote location). CLion will upload the 
code to a temporary location in the remote environment (`/tmp/tmp.XXX`), which you must then symlink 
to `/usr/local/code/faasm` as described above. 

Ensure the toolchain within CLion is pointing at the correct remote version of Clang that is installed 
as part of the Faasm Ansible playbook (i.e. `/usr/bin/clang(++)`), and possibly recent CMake.

I do **not** recommend setting a WASM/FAASM CMake profile because it will confuse your IDE a lot. 

Assuming you've gone through the steps outlined above _within the VM_, you should be able to call the 
`inv` commands as normal (rather than needing to use the Faasm CLI container within the VM).
