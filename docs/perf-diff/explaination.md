### Perf report

Symbol table:
```
functionDef35       log
functionDef2        __original_main
```

The global time spent in each section is very similar:
![Time division](time-division.png)

The loop bodies (pictures below) look quite similar -- unless the unknown/unknown:XX are something to worry about. The Wasm code 
fiddles a lot with the MM registers before the loop. Manually compiling the native code with `clang++ -O3 -mavx2 -S` for comparison lead
to the same code as shown below.

![main native](main-native.png)

![main Wasm](main-wasm.png)

I think this is not a good experiment for general-purpose speed comparison between Wasm and Native because it seems that
here the only difference is that MUSL's log is faster than GLibC's log. When looking at the `log` function ran in Wasm,
it is a lot smaller than the GLibC one, which is the only explanation I have here for the speed difference.

This experiment is however useful for understanding our second experiment because there is a log function taking 25% of
the run time of the native Mersenne Twister engine experiment but there is no sign of `log` seems absent from the Wasm
which however leads to the same result. I can only think the log was somehow optimised away?

### Confirmation

Compiling similar code at `-O3` natively but changing libc implementations gives the following:
* glibc: 14.2
* musl: 6.3

Confirming our hypothesis that the musl `log` function is better.

###  Perf Report

On the left, Wasm on the right, native. The symbol table is as follows. The
fact we only have the `main` function in Wasm seem to indicate there is some
inlining going on.
```
functionDef2        __original_main
```

![Perf report MT](mt-time.png)

And indeed we can compare the loop bodies in the main function we the native simply
calls the MT engine. And the Wasm code seem to be that same code but inlined (omitted
because it was too long).

The Native main loop uses `callq`, I'm not sure about perf's measures about the cost
of instructions (`callq` < `mov` < `add`), and it seems clear that it doesn't include
the time spent in `callq` because perf inverts the call graph.

### Confirmation

TODO confirm that:
* Wasm code generation is more prone to inlining which helped in this loopy context
* Wasm optimised the `logl` away, or else what happened to it?
