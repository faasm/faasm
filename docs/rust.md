# Rust Functions

Rust support in Faasm is still a work in progress, but is made possible 
by two other projects:

- [Faasm Rust workspace](https://github.com/mfournial/rust-faasm) - Scaffolding for building Faasm Rust functions
- [Faasm Rust bindings](https://github.com/mfournial/faasm-sys) - A Rust implementation of the Faasm host interface
 
The [Faasm Rust README](https://github.com/mfournial/rust-faasm) has all the info 
you need to write and deploy Rust functions in Faasm.
