# Getting started

Note that if you want to develop Faasm and make changes, you need to run through
the setup in the [development docs](development.md).

## Containers

Faasm runs a few different containers as defined in
[docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml). The most important are:

- `cpp` - used to compile and upload C/C++ functions (see the [`cpp`
  repo](https://github.com/faasm/cpp)).
- `python` - used to compile the CPython runtime and libraries, and
  upload Python functions (see the [`python`
  repo](https://github.com/faasm/python)).
- `upload` - the server that receives all function, state and shared file
  uploads.
- `worker` - one or more instances of the Faasm runtime that execute functions.
- `minio` - [Minio](https://min.io/) instance that holds uploaded functions and
  shared files.
- `redis` - [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance that holds internal scheduler
  state, and state shared between functions.
- `nginx` - [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) instance that load-balances requests
  between multiple workers.

Faasm generates machine code for all WebAssembly it needs to run (e.g. C/C++
functions, CPython, Python C-extensions). This, along with other local
development artifacts, is stored in the `dev` dir at the root of your local
checkout.

## Commandline interface

All Faasm projects use [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/), which means you can
do the following:

```bash
# List all commands
inv -l

# List all commands in the knative namespace
inv -l knative

# Show help for a given command
inv -h knative.ini-file

# Chain commands
inv flush invoke demo hello
```

## Local cluster

To start a local deployment, you can run:

```
docker compose up
```

## Writing and deploying functions

See the language-specific docs:

- [C/C++](cpp.md)
- [Python](python.md),

### Flushing

Faasm does a lot of caching, so if you want to update a function, you must flush
the system before invoking it again. This is done using the `flush` command.
Each language-specific container has its own way of flushing (e.g. `inv
func.flush` in the `cpp` container), but you can also do it from the Faasm CLI.

```bash
inv flush
```

The process for updating and invoking an updated function is:

- Modify and recompile the function
- Upload the function
- Flush
- Invoke function and see updated version
