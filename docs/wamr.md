# Faasm WAMR Support

Faasm currently provides only provides full support for 
[WAVM](https://github.com/wavm/wavm), but full 
[WAMR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime)
support, is also in development.

Faasm is independent of the underlying runtime, provided that runtime
can perform validation and execution, and be embedded in C/C++.
