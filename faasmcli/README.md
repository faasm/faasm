# Faasm CLI

This is the wrapper around the Faasm CLI and associated utilities. 
We just install this locally and do not publish it on PyPI.

To use the CLI, you need to run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

From this directory.

See the [local dev docs](../docs/local_dev.md) for info on using this package 
with IDEs.
