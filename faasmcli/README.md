# Faasm CLI

This is just a wrapper package around the Faasm CLI to allow it to be imported
and extended in other projects. **We don't publish it on PyPI**. 

You will _only_ need to install this package if you're using it for an external
project. It should work as part of normal Faasm without installing.

See the [local dev docs](../docs/local_dev.md) for info on using this package 
with IDEs.
