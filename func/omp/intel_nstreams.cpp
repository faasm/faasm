NAME:      nstream

PURPOSE:   To compute memory bandwidth when adding a vector of a given
           number of double precision values to the scalar multiple of
           another vector of the same length, and storing the result in
           a third vector.

USAGE:     The program takes as input the number of threads, the number
           of iterations to loop over the triad vectors, the length of the
           vectors, and the offset between vectors

           <progname> <# threads> <# iterations> <vector length> <offset>

           The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the
           algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.

FUNCTIONS CALLED:

           Other than OpenMP or standard C functions, the following
           external functions are used in this program:

           wtime()
           bail_out()
           checkTRIADresults()

NOTES:     Bandwidth is determined as the number of words read, plus the
           number of words written, times the size of the words, divided
           by the execution time. For a vector length of N, the total
           number of words read and written is 4*N*sizeof(double).

HISTORY:   This code is loosely based on the Stream benchmark by John
           McCalpin, but does not follow all the Stream rules. Hence,
           reported results should not be associated with Stream in
           external publications
REVISION:  Modified by Tim Mattson to handle OpenMP correctly
REVISION:  Modified by Rob Van der Wijngaart, December 2005, to
           parameterize vector size and offsets through compiler flags.
           Also removed all Stream cases except TRIAD.
REVISION:  Modified by Rob Van der Wijngaart, May 2006, to introduce
           dependence between successive triad operations. This is
           necessary to avoid dead code elimination
